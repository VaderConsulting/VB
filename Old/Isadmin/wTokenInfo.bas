' This function will determine whether or not a thread is running in the user context
' of the local Administrator account, you need to examine the access token associated
' with that thread using the GetTokenInformation() API, since this access token
' represents the user under which the thread is running. By default the token
' associated with a thread is that of its containing process, but this user context
' will be superceded by any token attached directly to the thread. So to determine a
' thread’s user context, first attempt to obtain any token attached directly to the
' thread with OpenThreadToken(). If this fails, and it reports an ERROR_NO_TOKEN,
' then obtain the token of the thread’s containing process with OpenProcessToken().
